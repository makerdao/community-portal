# Voting

## A Guide to Participating in MakerDAO Governance

Voting requires [Maker (MKR) tokens](https://community-development.makerdao.com/makerdao-mcd-faqs/faqs/mkr-token) and takes place on the [Governance Portal.](https://vote.makerdao.com/)

The Governance Portal lists Governance Polls and Executive Votes, while the Voting Contract section lets users set up and manage their voting contracts.

This guide introduces the Voting Contract that maintains the Maker Protocol. It is responsible for facilitating on-chain voting, conducted in the form of Governance Polls and Executive Votes.

## The Voting Contract

To vote, MKR owners must "lock" their tokens by transferring them into the Voting Contract. Votes are weighted based on the quantity of locked MKR. Currently, voters can withdraw "locked" MKR at any time. Future upgrades may introduce time-locks to prevent malicious actors.

MKR token holders have the option to set up their Voting Contract with a single hot or cold wallet, or as a linked wallet, for more secure voting.

A linked wallet setup lets users vote using a hot wallet, with MKR stored on a cold wallet.

### Voting Wallet Setup

Maker (MKR) token holders can set up their Voting Contract using a single hot or cold wallet or a linked-wallet setup for greater security.

#### Linked-Wallet Voting

With linked-wallet voting, MKR holders can use a hot wallet to vote with MKR safely stored on a cold wallet.

The hot wallet has permission to manage the Voting Contract but not to transfer tokens. If the hot wallet becomes compromised, MKR stored on the cold wallet is safe and unaffected. If this happens, the cold wallet has permission to break the link.

Users can avoid the Vote Proxy by depositing Maker (MKR) tokens directly into the Voting Contract. While single wallet voting is less secure, the initial setup is more convenient. Users who store MKR on MetaMask or other web wallets may find it the easiest way to start voting.

### Contract Setup and Voting Costs

Setting up the linked-wallet Voting Contract takes four transactions, split between the hot and cold wallets. Please ensure each wallet contains Ether (ETH) before starting.

Voting only requires signing a single transaction.

Total gas fees depend on current network congestion. Visit [ETH Gas Station](https://www.ethgasstation.info/) for recommended Gas Prices in GWEI.

## Governance Polls and Executive Votes

**How is the voting calculated?**

The total amount of MKR that votes for a given proposal decides the vote. The number of individual voters is irrelevant.

For example, if 50 stakeholders hold 600 MKR and vote for proposal A, while 100 stakeholders have 400 MKR and vote for proposal B, then Proposal A would win with 60% of the vote.

**What happens to my MKR when I am voting?**

MKR  locked in the Voting Contract is only accessible by the wallets used to set up the voting contract. For single-wallet contracts, only that wallet can withdraw MKR from the system. For linked-wallet contracts, either wallet can withdraw MKR to the cold wallet, but only the cold wallet has permission to transfer MKR.

### Governance Polls

Governance Polls occur on-chain and measure the sentiment of MKR voters. Access polls from the [Polling tab](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling?network=mainnet) on the [Governance Portal.](https://vote.makerdao.com/)

Polls typically run concurrently, allowing voters to participate in any number of them simultaneously. Some polls use [instant run-off voting](https://ballotpedia.org/Ranked-choice_voting_(RCV)) to let voters select multiple options.

The current schedule calls for polls to 'go live' every week on Monday at 16:00 UTC.

<CTA>

MKR holders may be asked to:

- Determine governance and DAO processes outside the technical layer of the Maker Protocol.
- Form consensus on important community goals and targets.
- Measure sentiment on potential Executive Vote proposals.
- Ratify governance proposals originating from the MakerDAO forum signal threads.
- Determine which values to set specific system parameters before confirming those values with an executive vote.
- Ratify risk parameters for new collateral types, as presented by Risk Teams.

</CTA>

Here is an example of voting in action on the Governance Portal:

#### How long is the voting period of a Governance Poll?

The voting period of a given Governance Poll varies. Regular polls of the same type are usually standardized and have the same duration.

The most common are three and seven day periods. Concurrently running polls do not necessarily have the same voting periods.

#### Where can I find on-chain Governance Polls?

Find live polls on the [Polling tab](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling?network=mainnet) on the [Governance Portal.](https://vote.makerdao.com/) Visit the [Maker Governance Analytics Dashboard](https://mkrgov.science/) for historic poll data.

#### How to create an on-chain Governance Poll?

Anyone can create an on-chain Governance Poll using the polling smart contract. At this time, there is no UI provided to do this.

Only elected Governance Facilitator(s) can put up polls that will display on the [Governance Portal.](https://vote.makerdao.com) Polls created by arbitrary Ethereum addresses **will not** appear.

MKR token holders or third parties may choose to develop special user interfaces or other voting frontends in the future.

### Executive Votes

Executive Votes occur on-chain and can be accessed from the [executive tab](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive?network=mainnet) on the [Governance Portal.](https://vote.makerdao.com/)

Executive Votes "execute" technical changes to the Maker Protocol. When active, each Executive Vote has a proposed set of changes to the Maker Protocol's smart contracts.

Unlike polls and other types of voting, Executive Votes use a 'Continuous Approval Voting' model.

An Executive Vote can occur at any time, but the current schedule calls for Executive Votes to go live on Fridays at 12 PM EST/9 AM PST/14:00 UTC.

<CTA>

A successful Executive Vote can:

- Add or remove collateral types.
- Add or remove Vault types.
- Adjust global system parameters.
- Adjust Vault-specific parameters.
- Replace modular smart contracts.

</CTA>

Anyone can create an on-chain Executive Vote using the MakerDAO governance contracts. However, at this time, there is no non-technical UI provided for this.

Users can create proposals, also known as [Slates](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/chief-detailed-documentation), using this [experimental portal](https://chief.makerdao.com/) or interacting directly with the smart contracts.

Here is an example of an executive vote on the Governance Portal:

![An example of Executive Vote](/images/voter-59.png)

#### Continuous Approval Voting

Executive proposals operate on Continuous Approval Voting. Competing proposals must garner more votes than the current state to pass.

The current Executive Proposal represents the current state of the system and is, therefore, continuously active.

<CTA>

There are three aspects to consider concerning Continuous Approval Voting:

- A vote creates a barrier for new proposals since new proposals need to surpass the last successful proposal's voting weight.
- Votes will remain in the system continuously to prevent malicious proposals from passing easily.
- The more votes there are on the system's current state, the more secure the system is from "rogue" proposals.

</CTA>

With Continuous Approval Voting, the continuity of staked votes challenges and reinforces the system's status quo through movements of the majority of votes between the most recent successful proposal and new proposals.

If MKR token holders disagree with a new proposal, they may cast their votes for the system's current state (or leave MKR there if they were already voting for the current state). Leaving their vote implies that they do not want to see anything changed.

It is not possible to reactivate an old proposal. A new proposal must be issued to revert changes.

#### Auditability

**New Votes**

The public is encouraged to self-audit the code before each vote.

Vist the guide on [Auditing Executive Spells.](/en/learn/Governance/audit-exec-spells/)

The team that creates these votes has made it easy for non-technical users to audit the code. They've even added explanatory notes to the code itself.

**User Voting Records**

The [voting portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/) displays the user's current vote on a given proposal page for quickly finding voting records. Alternatively, third-party tools like [mkrgov.science](https://mkrgov.science) collect voting data and even offer a [voting history lookup tool.](https://mkrgov.science/voting-history)
