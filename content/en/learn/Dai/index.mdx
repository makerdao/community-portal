## Learn about Dai, a Decentralized Cryptodollar on Ethereum

</Box>

</InfoBlock>


The Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is held in cryptocurrency wallets or within platforms and is supported on Ethereum and other popular blockchains.

Dai is easy to generate, access, and use. Users generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. This is how Dai is entered into circulation and how users gain access to liquidity. Others [obtain Dai](/learn/Dai/get-dai/) by buying it from brokers or exchanges, or simply by receiving it as a means of payment.

Once generated, bought, or received, [Dai can be used](/learn/Dai/use-dai/) in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency: it can be sent to others, used as payments for goods and services, and even held as savings through a feature of the Maker Protocol called the Dai Savings Rate (DSR).

Every Dai in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the Dai debt, and all Dai transactions are publicly viewable on the Ethereum blockchain.

Dai is collateral-backed money whose value is pegged to the US Dollar.

The Dai token lives on the Ethereum blockchain. All circulating Dai are generated from [Maker Vaults](/learn/vaults/) and are backed by a surplus of collateral assets.

Dai enables a wide range of financial activities and applications that have previously been untenable due to the volatility of legacy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

#### Prediction Markets:

 Long term betting becomes infeasible if users also have to bet on the future price of the asset. A cryptocurrency with price stability like Dai can be a natural choice.
