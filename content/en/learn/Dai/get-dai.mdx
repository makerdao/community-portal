## Buy Dai
The easiest way to get Dai? Buy it. Exchange a local currency for Dai, or trade another crypto-asset for it.

### Buy with Fiat Currency
Many exchanges support both Dai and fiat trading. Consider some of the popular services listed below.

Note: Make sure to check for any geographic restrictions. Users from restricted regions can research and explore alternative venues that might not be listed here.

### Buy with Cryptocurrency
There are more choices when trading from other crypto-assets. Acquire Dai on either centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, or peer-to-peer marketplaces.


#### Centralized Exchanges

If managing an Ethereum wallet or keeping it secure is a hassle, consider trading on a centralized exchange. They also tend to be more liquid, and some keep detailed trade records to simplify accounting later on.

##### Decentralized Exchanges &amp; DEX Aggregators

A great way to obtain Dai is with a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). By design, DEXs are non-custodial, not bound by geographic restrictions, and don't involve trusting third-parties. They can trade straight from their Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) while retaining full control of their assets.

DEXs offer numerous benefits, but there are trade-offs. 

*Trade-Offs:*

 	- Privacy: Trades happen on-chain and, therefore, are pseudo-public. In some regards, a public link between transactions and addresses reduces privacy. However, it may help third-party software keep track of trades for tax and documentation purposes.

 	- Slippage: For large orders there is a risk of receiving a different trade execution price than expected, this is called slippage. To reduce this risk, a DEX Aggregator can be used to split up a large order across multiple DEXs.

##### Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces

Peer-to-peer markets fill the gaps in regions that lack access to suitable exchanges or have restrictions on cryptocurrency trading. These marketplaces act as fiat on-and-off-ramps, enabling users to later trade on DEXs that offer more liquidity and fairer pricing.

## Earn Dai

Lend to borrowers, save on Oasis, get paid for work, tackle bounties, win prizes, get grant funding... There are loads of ways to earn Dai!

### Popular Ways to Earn

**Oasis Save**
- Users can save Dai on <a href="https://oasis.app">Oasis</a> to earn the Dai Saving Rate (DSR). The DSR smart contract, introduced with Multi-Collateral Dai, incentivizes saving. Dai locked in the DSR accrues continuously at a published annual rate.

**Learn**
- Earn Dai by learning about it. Some platforms, like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/earn/dai">Coinbase Earn</a>, offer Dai rewards for users that spend time learning about Dai and MakerDAO. 

**Work**
- Check out listings for jobs that pay in Dai and other cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://crypto.jobs/">Crypto.Jobs</a> hosts job openings for blockchain enthusiasts. Reddit channels, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Crypto/">r/Jobs4Crypto</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/CryptoRecruiting/">r/CryptoRecruiting</a>, have opportunities as well.

**Bounties**
- Receive Dai for completing bounty projects. MakerDAO's <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/community/projects/">bounties</a> are open to anyone, but other platforms, like <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a> and <a href="https://bounties.network/">Bounties Network</a>, offer rewards for contributors.


**Grants**
- Some organizations offer grants funded with Dai. For example, on <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/">Gitcoin Grants</a>, anyone can create a grant request and crowdsource fundraising. Maker’s <a href="https://community-development.makerdao.com/grants">Development Grants Program</a> is designed to directly support projects that increase Dai adoption.

**Lend**
- Earn Dai by lending on platforms like <a href="https://trade.dydx.exchange/balances">dYdX</a> and <a href="https://instadapp.io/compound/">Compound</a>. Please note, there are risks associated with lending, and users are encouraged to do proper due diligence.

**Hackathons**

**Video Game Tournaments**

## Borrow Dai
DeFi lending skips the red tape and cuts out the middlemen. Borrowing Dai is easy, but borrow responsibly.

There are two ways to "borrow" Dai within DeFi. Generate Dai on Oasis or use a lending platform.

#### Platform Risk
Be mindful of the risks associated with lending and borrowing on the blockchain. Consider a platform’s risk rating on <a href="https://defiscore.io/">DeFi Score</a> for help gauging a given platform's risk. Users are encouraged to do their own proper due diligence.
