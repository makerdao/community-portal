# Use DAI


Dai is a digital dollar! Don’t be afraid to treat it like any other money. Use Dai to save, lend, borrow, give to charity, make investments, cover business expenses, or buy goods and services.

*Note*: Spending and using Dai means using a Dia-friendly wallet to store, send, and recive Dai, so make sure to brush up on [wallets](/learn/Fundamentals/wallets/).

## DAI as Money

### Transfer Value
Send Dai to friends, acquaintances, enemies, and relatives. Send Dai internationally to transfer value across borders in just minutes, not days. Skip the middlemen, the exchange rates, the wire fees, and the questions.

## Spend DAI

#### Give to Charity
A great way to spend Dai? Donate it to charity! A lot of charities already accept cryptocurrency donations, and many find Dai to be the most convenient. Since it's stable, there's no rush to escape volatility by converting it to another asset.
