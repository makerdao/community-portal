# Stablecoins

## Learn about cryptocurrencies backed by underlying assets

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency backed by an underlying asset.

While digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether succeed as currencies on a number of levels, they are not ideal as a medium of exchange due to their volatility.

Stablecoins combine the censorship-resistance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether with the familiarity and ease-of-use associated with stable fiat currencies.

### Types of Stablecoins

Stablecoins can be categorized by their underlying collateral and how much collateral the system requires.

Hypothetically, any asset of value can be used as collateral. Most stablecoins currently fall into one of two categories:

- Fiat-backed

- Cryptocurrency-backed

Stablecoins may also be:

<List>

- Over-collateralized 
    - These systems require a deposit of greater value than the stablecoins minted by the protocol.

- Fully-collateralized 
    - These systems require a deposit equal of equal value to the stablecoins minted by the protocol.

- Under-collateralized 
    - These systems operate on fractional reserves and allow deposits holding less value than the stablecoins minted by the protocol.

- Non-collateralized 
    - These systems use algorithms that increase or decrease the amount of tokens in circulation to affect monetary policy and maintain a stable value.
