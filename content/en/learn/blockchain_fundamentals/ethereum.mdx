# Ethereum

Ethereum is a blockchain designed to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications.

The platform can be described as an open-source, public, permissionless, distributed ledger.

## Smart contracts

Smart contracts enable developers to build applications with business logic that execute in a trustless environment, while leveraging the high availability of the Ethereum network.
