# Community Projects

Got an idea for improving the MakerDAO community coordination or resources? Community Development can provide up to 5,000 Dai to help make it happen. In order to fund projects we have a useful program called  CDIPs.

The Community Development Initiative Proposal (CDIP) is the scoping and framing tool for anyone interested in receiving funding for proposing new MakerDAO community initiatives or resources.
