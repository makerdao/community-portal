# Intermediate

Our Basic guide showed how Callouts and CTAs require each piece of content to start on a new line.
This is because each new mdx line is interpreted as a new **child** when it is passed to the magic box which
turns it into a React component. This means, when using more advanced components, you'll need to be aware not
just of the props you're specifying in the actual tag, like `primaryOutline` or `icon`, but also the order
in which you write the content in each component and **leaving new lines between each separate piece**.

<Aligner center sx={{marginBottom: 3}}>

</Aligner>

## Lists

The list component is an example of why mdx having an opinion in how it renders components works
in our favor. With mdx, we can order our children consistently.
This allows us to create smart hooks for rendering each element, which is a fancy way of saying that
we can create really beautiful lists with more functionality and visual pizzaz than you could ever
dream of having in normal md files. Let's dive right in.

The rule is **scripting and composition come FIRST**, which just means that you can use the list component
in the same way you'd write lists normally. Generally we write lists beginning with a hyphen in md. You can use the hyphen,
or not, when writing content in our `List` component - either way it will render the same thing:

```md:title=basic-list.mdx
<List>

Hello World

</List>

<List>

Header

Sub Content

</List>

<List>

<Link to="/">

Hello World

</Link>

</List>
```

All end up looking like this:

<List>

Hello World

</List>

<List>

<Box>

Header

Sub Content

</Box>

</List>

<List>

<Link to="/">

Hello World

</Link>

</List>

If you want a list element with sub content, that's easy enough to organise:

```md:title=subcontent-list.mdx
<List>

<Box>

Header

Sub content

</Box>

</List>
```

Which renders like this:

<List>

<Box>

Header

Sub content

</Box>

</List>

For more complex sub content, we recommend using a Box:

```md:title=list-v2.mdx
<List>

A Great Header

<Box>
      
<CTA> Now with a Call to Action! </CTA>

</Box>

</List>
```

<List>

<Box>

A Greatent Header

<Box>

<CTA> Now with a Call to Action! </CTA>

</Box>

</Box>

</List>

Want to render a few links? Easy! **Please note**: these links are wrapped in a 
Box, and are not separate Link Elements (see more on this below).

```md:title=list-of-links.mdx
<List>
 
<Box>

<Link to="/">Writing style guide →</Link>

</Box>

</List>
```

Which ends up looking like this:

<List>
 
<Box>

<Link to="/">Writing style guide →</Link>

</Box>

</List>

<CTA>

NOTE: Mind the gap! There should be a gap between list elements that will be on the same level
or mdx will not recognize them as seperate elements.

</CTA>

It's possible to have an entire list element be a link by providing the Link component like so:

```md:title=list-as-link.mdx
<List>

<Link to="https://makerdao.com">

MakerDao

</Link>

<Link to="/learn">

Learn

</Link>

</List>
```

Which both end up looking like this:

<List>

<Link to="https://makerdao.com">

MakerDao

</Link>

<Link to="/learn">

Learn

</Link>

</List>

These links are also capable of having subcontent as well:

<List>

<Link to="https://makerdao.com">

MakerDao

Sub content

</Link>

<Link to="/learn">

Learn

subcontent

</Link>

</List>

## Accordion

So you want to make a list, but with a lot of content, and you don't want to take up a lot of space
on the page? Sounds like you need a collapsable accordion menu... The Accordion component is ultra simple and
scripting works with the same child rule. Except this time:

1. The first child that appears is the header of the accordion.
2. Everything AFTER the first child will be included in the collapsable content.

```md:title=accordion.mdx
<Accordion>

## Hello World

Some other content

</Accordion>

<Accordion>

Am I eligible to receive a micro-grant if Maker and Dai are only one part of my agenda?

Some other content inside of an accordion!

> CTA content inside of Accordion

![Onboarding](../../../../content/images/vault-onboarding-1.png)

### Let's see how this works?

</Accordion>

<Accordion openIcon="chevron_down" closeIcon="chevron_up">

Of course, it's also possible to have your own icons for opening and closing

</Accordion>

<Accordion defaultOpen>

And you can control whether the menu defaults to being open or closed...

This content will show by default now.

</Accordion>
```

## Checklist

This is another simple component meant to be more visually engaging. It is **not** interactive - it's
just meant to organise content in a specific way, mostly for guide pages like preparing for hackathons etc.
Like all the above, it too follows the Child Rule.

```md:title=checkbox.mdx
<Checklist>

We can put **anything** inside this component

> How about a CTA?

<StatusBanner notice>

Or a Status Banner...

</StatusBanner>

<Image src="../../../../content/images/vault-onboarding-2.png" />

#### Now we're talking!

</Checklist>
```

## Process Stepper

The process stepper is a carbon copy of the list component, except shaved down to ignore the Link requirements.
This means the same mindset of scripting a process element is in place. The children dictate the content,
and how the children are seperated determine each step in the process.

```md:title=process-stepper.mdx
<Process>

### Child 1

Child 2

<Box>

### Child 3

Bunches and bunches of content can go in here. Anything you like, tbh.

</Box>

<Box>

### Child 4

> Even CTAs

</Box>

</Process>
```

or inline code
```

</Box>

</Process>

## Box

You'll notice that we've begun wrapping our children in boxes. This is the way to overcome the child rule
and sneak in more content to one specific child should the need arise. If you wrap your multi-line content
into a `<Box>`, then this will be read and rendered as a single child. You can already see how useful this
is in the context of complex lists or process steppers, and it will become more apparent with other, more visual
components like Touts.

Basically, a `<Box>` is just the old html `<div>` element updated for this brave new world we'll be building together.
Now it's time to head over to the Advanced tutorial and begin understanding our visual components and how to style everything.
