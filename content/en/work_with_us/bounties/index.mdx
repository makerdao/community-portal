# Bounties

### Bounties are small to medium tasks that need help. They mostly cover work related to this site. You can earn Dai by completing bounties.

## Requirements

Most bounties require knowledge of:

- [ ] **GitHub**  We manage the bounty process through Github issues and project boards.
- [ ] **Google Docs**  Collaborators will review your drafts and early iterations in Google Docs.
- [ ] **Markdown**  Final site content is written in markdown.
- [ ] **Maker**  Learn about Maker. The community has created plenty of reading material. [Learn about Maker](https://github.com/ryancreatescopy/community/tree/73adbf56ade73878c1f69ecb7426267192fd13cc/faqs/README.md).
