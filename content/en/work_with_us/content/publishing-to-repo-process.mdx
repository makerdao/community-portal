# Publishing process

Publishing new content follows this process. Please make sure you’ve already proposed your idea in our community development chat before following these steps. This is important so we can arrange a reviewer and organise payment for content. 

<Process>

<Box>

## Write first draft in google docs
Make sure to name versions, for example Dai_v0.1. 
Change to Dai_v1 after one round of feedback. Dai_v2 after a second round and so on.

## Get it reviewed
Ping the reviewer as they’ll need to double check work and bring fresh eyes. In some rare cases work will also need to be reviewed by the legal team and/or technical stakeholders.

## Convert to Markdown
Once approved, convert the document into markdown using [HackMD](http://hackmd.io/) or [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download); alternatively google docs has a quite useful add-on named [whatever the fuck that add on is called](). 
If the document needs fancier components it's likely that .mdx will serve the need. Follow guides to using .mdx in this here repo: <Link to="/develop/content/cheat-sheet">mdx cheat sheet</Link>

Want to fancier pieces to a page? Building something elaborate? Please feel free to dive down the rabbit hole of [comm-dev's mdx implementation](../develop/content/migration-for-content-team.mdx).

If uncomfortable with GitHub there's a GitHub guide where we’ll talk through the process. [Community development GitHub guide](/using-github.mdx)
