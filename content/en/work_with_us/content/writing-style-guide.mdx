# Writing Style Guide

The MakerDAO Community Writing Style Guide summarizes the standards and best practices Writers should follow when contributing to Community Development resources.

<Callout icon="press" secondary>

In addition to this guide, Writers are encouraged to study the [contributor resources](/work_with_us/content/) before starting work on a Community Development project.

- [Contributor Tools Guide](/work_with_us/content/contributor-tools/)
- [Reviewer Guide](/work_with_us/content/reviewer-guide/)

## Writing Intent and Tone

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 2 }}>

---

MakerDAO Community Development materials should cater to readers who are unfamiliar with the Maker system. Writers should also assume that their readers have tight schedules and short attention spans.

As such, Writers should focus on communicating concepts as clearly and succinctly as possible.

- Use simple language.
- Use short, concise sentences.
- Avoid unnecessary words.
- Remain open and objective.
- Provide examples when possible.
- Provide examples to help explain concepts, but avoid overcomplicating them.
  - Use math when necessary, but keep it simple.
- Link to basic terms if necessary.

</Box>

## Writer Guidelines

### General Rules

- Run all drafts through [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) regularly, and before final submissions.
  - Grammarly will catch most spelling and grammatical errors.
  - Copy rendered text into Grammarly and address any mistakes it flags.
    - HackMD does not identify spelling and grammatical errors.
    - Grammarly will miss errors if it’s given raw Markdown text.
    - Be careful of copy and pasting code from grammarly to VScode, grammarly may mess with formatting.

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 5 }}>

<Callout icon="warning">

**Please Note**

- When migrating to a new document (i.e., from Google Docs to HackMD):
  - Leave a note in the old file.
  - Provide a link to the latest version.
- Do not blindly accept Grammarly suggestions.
  - Review edits to make sure they make sense.

</Box>

</Box>

### Naming Conventions

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 3 }}>

---

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 4 }}>

#### Cryptocurrencies

- When directly referring to the creation, destruction, or manipulation of a token \(particularly as it relates to tooling\):
  - Use the capitalized TLA version: `DAI`
  - **Example:** “Draw DAI against ETH from a Vault.”
- Similarly, when referring to exchange pairs:
  - Use: `ETH/DAI`
- When referencing the token as a currency, in an instructional or conversational setting, or as a conceptual product of the Foundation or its systems:
  - Use: `Dai`
  - **Example:** “Dai is a price-stable asset that can be used as money.”

</Box>

---

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 4 }}>

#### MakerDAO

- When referring to MakerDAO as a smart contract system, use "The Maker Protocol."
  - **Example:** “The Maker Protocol facilitates DAI generation."
- When referring to MakerDAO as a body of MKR voters and the general stakeholder community, use "Maker Community" or "MakerDAO."
  - **Example:** "MakerDAO passed a vote to increase the Stability Fee."
  - **Example:** "The Maker Community passed a vote to increase the Stability Fee."
- Use "Maker" for casual references to MakerDAO and the Maker Protocol as a whole.
- Always distinguish the Maker Foundation from MakerDAO.

</Box>

</Box>

### Numbers

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 3 }}>

---

- Spell out numbers below 10.
  - **Examples:** one, two, three, etc.
- Use numerals for numbers above 10, unless starting a sentence.
- For numbers with million, billion, or trillion, use figures in all except casual cases.
  - **Standard:** "The nation has 1 million citizens."
  - **Casual:** "I'd like to make a billion dollars."

</Box>

### Lists

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 3 }}>

---

When bulleted and numbered lists contain complete sentences, capitalize the first word, and follow each with a period. If list items are phrases, no capitalization or punctuation is required.

- Use [parallel construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelism_%28grammar%29) for each item in a list.
- Start with the same [part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech) for each item \(in this case, a verb\).
- Use the same verb [tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense#English) for each item.
- Use the same [voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_%28grammar%29) for each item.
- Use the same sentence type \(statement, question, exclamation\) for each item.
- List items that include definitions should look like this:
  - **Team:** Core team and Advisors are critical to MakerDAO's success.
  - **Community**: Sentiment analysis is invaluable.
- Use dashes rather than asterisks for unordered lists.
  - **Correct:** `-`
  - **Incorrect:** `*`
- Alphabetize lists of names unless there is a clear priority at work.
- Do not use ordered \(numbered\) lists unless order matters.
- Ordered list items should use the `#1` repeated.
  - Markdown will automatically generate numbers.

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 3 }}>

**Example:**
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
4. Item 3a
5. Item 3b

</Box>

</Box>

### Links

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 3 }}>

---

- Use [relative links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/how-to-write-links) when cross-referencing files from [community repositories](https://github.com/makerdao/community) on MakerDAO's GitHub.
  - Use MakerDAO's \[GitHub\]\(\(./makerdao\)\) file structure for reference.
- Use \[absolute links\]\(\([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/how-to-write-links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/how-to-write-links)\)\) and standard web URLs when referencing external resources.
- Create descriptive hyperlinks and avoid generic language.
  - **Descriptive:** Learn more at [Awesome-MakerDAO.](https://awesome.makerdao.com/)
  - **Generic:** Learn more [here.](/work_with_us/content/)
- Include a `.` inside the link for sentences that end with a link.
- When creating links for parallel translated documents, make sure to update relative links to reflect the correct heading.

<Callout icon="question_o" secondary>

**Example:**

en: faqs/cdp.md#what-are-collateralized-debt-positions

es: faqs/es/cdp.md#qué-son-las-posiciones-de-deuda-colateralizadascdp

ko: faqs/ko/cdp.md#부채-담보부-포지션collateralized-debt-positions-cdp이란-무엇인가요

</Callout>

</Box>

### Tables of Contents

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 3 }}>

---

- Include a table of contents for documents that span several pages and multiple sections.
- Use the raw Markdown from the Table of Contents above as a template.
  - Be sure to include the line breaks `---` as well to keep formatting consistent.
- The table of contents should list relevant sections for easy navigation.

</Box>

## Markdown Guide

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 2 }}>

---

MakerDAO documents posted on GitHub are written in Markdown, a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

- Include line breaks above and below headings.
- Use top-level headers `#` only once per document.
  - Do not make multiple top-level headings.
- Avoid repeat headings.
  - They will break auto-generated navigation.
- Avoid trailing spaces.
- Do not use:
  - Em or en [dashes:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hyphens_and_dashes) `—`
  - Ampersands `&` in titles and headers.
  - Pipes `|` in titles and headers.
  - Curly quotes. Use the plaintext version.
    - **Correct:** `"`
    - **Incorrect:** `“`
  - Escaping parentheses. Use normal parentheses.
    - **Correct:** `(SOMETHING)`
    - **Incorrect:** `\(SOMETHING\)`
- Ensure there is a single hard return at the end of a .md file.
- Use emojis and .MDX React components to call attention to an important point, when necessary.
  - Practice discretion and use them sparingly.
  - This [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) lists emojis and their Markdown shortcuts.
