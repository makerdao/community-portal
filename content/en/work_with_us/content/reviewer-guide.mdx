# Reviewer Guide

## Reviewers are responsible for editing and maintaining MakerDAO’s Community Development resources. All writers and contributors are welcome to assume the Reviewer role.

This guide introduces the review process and outlines editing standards. MakerDAO expects its Writers and Reviewers to adhere to the principles described within this guide and all other Comm-Dev [contributor guides.](/work_with_us/)

<Callout icon="warning" secondary>

**Please Note:** 

Reviewers should be comfortable working with Google Docs and HackMD. They should be open to learning the basics of Markdown, GitHub, and VSCode.

## Reviewer Roles

Reviewer roles for Community Development projects are divided into three categories.

<List>

<Box sx={{ paddingX: 4 }}>

**Tone | Grammar**

Reviewers assess content and resources for tone and consistency. They ensure that all documents adhere to the Writing Style Guide.
- This role does not require in-depth knowledge about MakerDAO.

</Box>

<Box>

**Content | Concepts**

Reviewers edit content and make sure that all ideas presented are factual and easy to comprehend.
- Content Reviewers should have a deeper understanding of MakerDAO and its functions.

</Box>

<Box>

**Maintenance**

Reviewers refer to document-specific maintenance guides to make sure that existing documents are standardized and up to date.
- Check GitHub for a document-specific maintenance guide before working on an existing resource.

The guideline below offers general advice to ease the Reviewer's work process.

---

- Existing documents may be at any stage:
  - Google Doc
  - HackMD
  - VSCode
  - Live on GitHub
- Give existing documents a full read-through before starting work.
- When possible, improve the clarity and presentation of the material.
- Check for and correct any typos, grammatical errors, and deviations from the [Writing Style Guide.](/work_with_us/content/writing-style-guide/)
- Expand on and update concepts as MakerDAO grows.
  - Incorporate new developments within MakerDAO.
  - Update documents to reflect the latest terminology and language as Maker grows and standards change.
- Add cross-linking to relevant resources.
- Take into account that final iterations are converted to Markdown and published on GitHub.
  - Avoid including direct links in a Google Doc.
    - Use the Markdown format to simplify conversion later on.
    - **Example:** `[link](https://link.com)`
- Use the Google Docs heading presets.
  - These work well with tools that convert documents into Markdown.
  - Headings can also help structure a document.
    - Google's outline tool follows the preset header formats.
