## Disclaimer

These meetups are not for speculating on the price of the token or general hype. Events should focus on the MakerDao ecosystem, how MakerDao and Dai interact with DeFi, decentralized governance, and other relevant topics.


The goal of hosting meetups is to bring people together and educate them about decentralized finance, Dai, and MakerDAO. When talking about the MKR token, the goal should be to educate the attendees about the purpose and utility of the token.
