# Hackathons

These events are intended to encourage diverse groups of people to hack together prototypes for new kinds of products and services. 
They are a great way to meet new and talented people; learn new skills; get access to the latest and greatest tools; and to be 
noticed by established communities like MakerDAO. We use these events to find and fund great developers who can help us continue building better money.

If you’re organising a hackathon and want to request funding, you can [apply for a grant](/funding/hackathon-funding.md) paid in Dai.
