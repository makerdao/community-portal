## First Hackathon?

They're a great way to meet new and talented people, learn new skills, get access to the latest and most excellent tools, and get noticed by communities like MakerDAO. We've prepared a guide to help you understand what to expect. It covers what you should bring and some best practices for navigating these events and integrating what you learn afterward.
