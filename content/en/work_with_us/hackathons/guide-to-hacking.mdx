# Guide to hacking with MakerDAO

## Developer resources

Any project seems complex at first. This guide will get anyone started with MakerDAO with the most up-to-date documentation, 
as well as all the open source tools built to help you hack together something genuinely valuable.

## What should I bring

### In-Person hackathons:

These events can be quite a lot to take in at first if you've never been to something like it, so we've put together a list of 
**non-obvious essentials** to help you prepare:

<Checklist>

Notebook/scratch paper + pen/pencil  

Toothbrush & paste  

Deodorant  

Sleeping bag/blanket, pillow  

Sweater or jacket  

Umbrella or raincoat  

Extra clothes depending on the length of the event  

Good vibes

</Checklist>

### Virtual Hackathons:

In the current global climate, virtual events have become much more popular. Obviously, you need not bring anything, 
but familiarizing yourself with MakerDAO before the event begins is a great way to get a headstart so and spend all the time building.

We recommend you join our <Link to="https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development" icon="rocketchat">community chat</Link> 
and ask questions either in the #dev or #community-development channels to get ahead.

## Best Practices

<Checklist>

Take advantage of the opportunity to find mentors. A more experienced guide can help find up-to-date resources and suggest the latest, most efficient ways of building.

Set up a team ahead of time. Try and find a diverse group of people with different skills to round out your idea.

Hackathons are a meeting place for many different types of developers. Everyone is nervous. Most of us are introverts, so don't be afraid to take a chance and make some new friends who may be able to teach you something different.

Don't rely on the WiFi; download the latest software you need ahead of time.

Self-care is important. Be sure to get good rest and allow yourself to take breaks.

Balance work and play. There are both interesting people to meet and exciting, winning ideas to work on.

Think of your project as having core-features and nice-to-have features. Define the core features up-front, and add the nice-to-haves only after the main features are built.

Check and submit your hackathonâ€™s submission system at least an hour before the deadline. Most hackathons use a system like DevPost to keep the submission process running smoothly, but uploading can crash last minute.
 
Try to polish up for presentations. Use this hackathon and its platform to build a portfolio for yourself.

</Checklist>

## Post-Hackathon Best Practices

<Checklist>

Update your repository or project page to reflect the current status of the project.

Tweet about your project. There may be other developers interested in helping you continuing to build out your hack.

Stay in touch with your teammates.

</Checklist>

## Grants

The Maker Grants Program uses Hackathons as a way to find good candidates for development grants. Winners are often fast-tracked.

We review all submissions and may reach out to interesting projects that were not necessarily winners. If you follow the best practices above, 
it'll be easier for us to contact you after the event.
