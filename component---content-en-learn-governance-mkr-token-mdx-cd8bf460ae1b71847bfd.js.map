Voting is used to execute changes to parameters inside of the Maker Protocol like Stability Fees, the DSR, Debt Ceilings, and many others.

The tokens are created and destroyed under different circumstances. MKR is destroyed when the Maker Protocol’s system surplus exceeds a minimum threshold, resulting in excess Dai being auctioned for MKR that is then destroyed. Inversely, when the Maker Protocol is running a deficit and the system debt exceeds a maximum threshold, MKR is created and auctioned for Dai in order to recapitalize the system.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`What responsibilities do MKR holders have?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The primary responsibility of MKR holders is to ensure the stability of the Dai Peg and the overall health of the Maker Protocol. It is also in MKR holders’ interest to focus on improving and growing the Maker Protocol by building out the governance processes and infrastructure that enable the effective management of the system. This includes, but is not limited to, establishing risk assessment standards for onboarding new Collateral and Vault types, ratifying role mandates and electing appropriate parties, establishing standards around vote types, and much more.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Another important responsibility for MKR holders is to communicate publicly about their views on the various issues that Maker governance is addressing at any given time. Participating seriously in forum discussions and voicing opinions, and the reasoning behind them, is important because of the public and decentralized nature of the protocol and its governance.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`What voting rights do MKR holders have?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`MKR holders have the ability to enact technical changes to the Maker Protocol itself and also to ratify decisions on-chain about non-technical matters.

This means that MKR acts as a Collateral of last resort to absorb losses beyond the expected losses from Collateral locked in Vaults. If MKR is being used as a Collateral of first resort i.e. as a collateral type locked in Vaults, then it would take away from its effectiveness as a Collateral of last resort.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A negative feedback loop would occur in a scenario when a falling MKR price would trigger the liquidation of MKR-collateralized Vaults, further causing downward pressure on MKR price. While downward price pressure in a liquidation is a risk applicable to any collateral type, the systemic risk with MKR is potentially greater because falling MKR price directly reduces the amount of value available to recapitalize all collateral types across the Maker Protocol. Downward spirals in MKR price also make the Maker Protocol more vulnerable to governance attacks, wherein the cost of buying enough MKR to vote for changes favorable to an attacker becomes more affordable. Furthermore, if both systemic bad debt and MKR-Vault liquidations were to happen at the same time, then they would become self-reinforcing, increasing the risk of a severe collapse of the value of MKR and reducing its effectiveness as a Collateral of last resort.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally, there is the argument about circular financing. It stands to reason that the value of MKR may be correlated to the total amount of Dai in circulation. Additional Dai generated from MKR-Vaults would create a positive feedback loop for the price of MKR, allowing even more Dai to be generated from those Vaults. This behavior adds systemic risk.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Will MKR token Dilution be able to cover all Dai if the value of their backing Collateral goes to zero?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The event of a Collateral asset losing all value is considered a Black Swan, which is defined as unprecedented, unexpected, and catastrophic. This makes it very difficult to predict the likelihood and severity of existential threats to the system. There is no guarantee that MKR Dilution will always be sufficient.`}</p>\n    <p>{`MKR Dilution can recapitalize the system to a certain limit. The severity of the situation is important to consider. If the severity of the situation is high enough, then it may be viable for MKR holders to execute an Emergency Shutdown which would result in Dai being a pro-rata claim on the Maker Protocols Collateral portfolio.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How do I redeem old MKR?`}</h2>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://makerdao.com/redeem/\"\n      }}>{`Makerdao.com/redeem`}</a>{` is the only official page for upgrading MKR tokens.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Important note:`}</strong>{` Do NOT send tokens directly to the redeemer contract.

MKR Dilution occurs when the system is running a deficit and needs to be recapitalized. If the system is going through Emergency Shutdown, the price feeds and state of the system will be frozen at a particular moment in time. MKR Dilution might occur in the moments preceding that if the Emergency Shutdown is due to a severe market failure that would cause many Vaults to default.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are no guarantees whatsoever relating to the future value of MKR, in particular, if Emergency Shutdown happens.
